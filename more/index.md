In order to support the blogs, I created some github repositories to implement some of the packages for research use. It won't be a replacement for many other commercial softwares, just for illustration use.

Most of the codes are coming in C/C++/Fortran, some of them will be in Matlab script and Julia  or Python 2.7(or Python 3).
