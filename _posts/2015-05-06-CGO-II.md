In 2D, Beltrami equation gives

$$\overline{\partial} f =\mu \overline{\partial f}$$

where $\sup|\mu|<1$.

It is known that CGO solution $f_{\mu}(z,k) = e^{ikz} M_{\mu}(z,k)$ , when $|z|\to\infty$
$$M(z,k) = 1 + O(1/z)$$

The classical Calderon problem stability and uniqueness can be done with extensive analysis with Betrami($\overline{\partial}$ technique), and then use micro-local to prove. It is quite interesting to see the same kind of instability in 2D and 3D.

Recently, Bukhgeim's result uses stationary phase to prove the uniqueness, and also can be used to show the stability. I would prefer this method, since it is more general, only uses the orthogonal relation and does not require other information. The $\overline{\partial}$ method starts directly from the equation and compares $\mu$ by writing
$$\mu = \frac{\overline{\partial}f}{\overline{\partial f}}$$

which is not intuitive enough.
