The qPAT (quantitative photo-acoustic tomography) is a poppular topic among inverse problem community. It is a well-posed hybrid problem with two weak-coupled sub-problems.

- Photo-acoutisc imaging

  In a micro case, when laser access the tissue, the light will transport inside the tissue, some are absorbed, and some are scattered.

- Wave propagation

  In a macro case, when tissue is excited by a short time pulse of laser, absorbed energy levels temperature and make tissue propagate fast moving ultra-sound, which has very good property in going through objects, measuring the ultra-sound information on boundary of domain  

In general, the imaging process satisfies a full transport equation since tissue is not like many other material, it is highly anisotropic, cannot regard as a diffusive process.

The other part, which has been studied for a long time, it is a wave equation stated as

$$\begin{aligned}
p_{tt} - \nabla(\lambda \nabla p) &= 0 \\\\
p(0, x) &= H(x) \\\\
p_t(0, x) &= 0
\end{aligned}$$

the measured pressure is the $p(x, t)$ on boundary, or planar measurement which take advantage of Radon transform and reducing the random noise by cancellation and recovering the internal(source) data $H(x)$.

Usually we simply assume this step is very stable.

For the imaging part, it is formulated as

$$\begin{aligned}
L(\gamma, \sigma) u &= 0 \\\\
u &= f
\end{aligned}$$

where $f\in H^{1/2}(\partial\Omega)$, $L$ is the operator for light transport (either regard as a transport equation or a diffusive process), the measurement is $H(x) = \Gamma(x) \sigma(x) u$, it is known that recovering $\Gamma, \gamma, \sigma$ is impossible without other measurements, but known one of them and recovering the other two is unique and stable with multiple measurements of $H$. (so is multiple $f$).

If the imaging is using diffusing process, then theorems are ready. If the imaging is transporting, the recovering should be more stable.
