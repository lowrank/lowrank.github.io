title:  Reading Note on multi-variable complex functions
---

This is a reading note on reading the classical books on several complex variable functions.

#### Holomorphic functions
For several variable complex function, holomorphic is not different from single variable case, the holomorphic property is assigned to each dimension by ``Osgood's Lemma``. The converse is also valid. Separation of the variables will directly give the Cauchy formula,

$$f(z) = \left(\frac{1}{2\pi i}\right)^n \int_{\Delta} \frac{f(\xi) d\xi_1,\cdots d\xi_n}{(\xi_1 - z_1)\cdots (\xi_n - z_n)}$$

Then everything from single variable, such as Cauchy-Riemann equations and maximal modulus theorem are naturally translated to several variable case.

The topological properties inherit from continuous function in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ and holomorphic function becomes a subring trivially. Especially for holomorphic functions, the singularity properties and extension properties are exactly the same as single variable case.

The approximation theory are rather interesting,  holomorphic functions can be approximated by polynomials uniformly on any compact set, which in turns indicates polynomials are dense in holomorphic functions on simply connected domain.
