title:  Neumann data for computing
---

For many inverse problems, the Neumann data is obtained as measurements. But it seems computationally there is some issue with computational inverse problems. The most common problem is how to compute the Neumann data. For geometries with corners, how to define the Neumann data? With discretization, the Neumann data can be evaluated in the interior of each segments on boundaries and avoid corners. Such method works well enough if discretization is fine, and is suitable for adjoint-state technique.

The problem rises when the Green's formula cannot hold exactly, that is why matrix method is more used than adjoint-state plus Green's formula. Once everything is put in matrix form, we need several ingredients: 1. Dirichlet to Neumann map. 2. Solution matrix. Then taking derivatives is simply transposing the matrices.
