title:  Neumann data for computing
---

This problem concerns the Neumann data in computing, mostly in PDE based optimization or imaging techniques, the Neumann is usually taken as measurements in photon-based experiments. One problem with the Neumann data for numerical simulation is: it is not defined well on corners, where a normal is missed, however, for Green's function based problem (linear problems), there is a way to translate the Neumann data into weak form, where we only have to weakly define use it in a variational way. Such method works perfectly in many second order PDE related problems, the adjoint-state method can be used naturally here.

On the other hand, if the PDE is nonlinear, we still can define our Neumann data, but this time we cannot use the Green's formula to weakly use the information. Linearization is a crude way for such circumstance since if the perturbation does not live in linear regime, the result could be terribly wrong. The only way that works well currently is to make everything matrix based. It lacks the convenience from the adjoint-state method, but it is not too expensive.
