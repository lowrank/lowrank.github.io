Now the time complexity is $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ is the side size for 2D problem.

The key point is that line integral is scaled in M2L for each level, which results with a constant factor more than usual fast multi-pole. However, it is possible to optimize the factor, but very hard to get it very far.
