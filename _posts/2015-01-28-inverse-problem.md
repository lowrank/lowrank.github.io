Numerically, solving inverse problem requires two processes.

#### Forward Process

Forward Process/Problem usually involves solving equations numerically.

#### Backward Process / Inversion

Backward Process/Problem is more difficult since most problems are ill-posed. The process might require optimization algorithms which indicates multiple (maybe many) calls of forwarding model. In order to speedup reconstruction, reducing forwarding time complexity is necessary.
