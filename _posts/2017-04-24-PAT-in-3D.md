It is quite challenging to numerically implement PAT in 3D. Especially for very high resolution imaging reconstruction.

Even for solving the photon diffusion part is nontrivial on a grid of ``512x512x512``. To stably get recovery in diffusion coefficient, we need to solve the multi-source problem to at least third order, which means ``H`` must be non-vanishing and accurate up to error of ``h^3``. If we are solving the equation with finite element forward solver, it is not cheap at all. The system will involve millions of dofs, only supercomputer or cluster could help.

On our laptop, it is still unclear that whether a mesh larger than ``64x64x64`` could work under second order FE smoothly. Down-sampling from the data, it is still reasonable to get some reconstruction up to some resolution.

All we need is a fast forward solver, with parallelism, an option will be ``PETSc``. The detailed implementation could be any, ``fenics`` is well-built for finite element solvers on top of ``PETSc``, could run in parallel over many cores.

``MATLAB`` will be a tough choice to handle too large system, it does not provide good support on MPI either. ``Julia`` has some good libraries and graph tools, but not as many as ``Python`` currently does.

An interface prototype is needed then. [TO BE CONTINUED]
