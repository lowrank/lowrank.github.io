title:  Blue Sky and Purple Sky

Why blue sky? In middle school, the physics books said it is because of scattering. It seems that the light at each frequency should be scattered, but why blue? The physicists argue that the scattering strength depends on the wave length, the shorter the stronger. Then we might want to ask, why blue, not purple?

The amount of blue and purple light from the sun are approximately equal from measurements, which implies that we should see the deep blue sky in the day. However, our eyes are always trying to fool our brain, when some combination of lights with certain spectrum arrives, our eye cannot distinguish it from  another combination of lights with the same spectrum. It is like, we can see white lights, but we cannot what kind of lights are making this happen. When purple light and blue light are arriving our eyes, we will detect it as some blue light plus a white light. The reason that we have such detection is because our eyes are used to such separation (the sun light).

The reason for the scattering strength is based on the theory in scattering. The scattering coefficient in transport model is based on the so-called Rayleigh scattering.

$$\sigma_s ‚àù\frac{1+\cos^2\theta}{2} \frac{1}{\lambda^4}$$

we can see that if wave length is shorter, then scattering is stronger, which means a relatively large portion of photons will travel back. And for red light or long wave length lights, the scattering will be relatively weak and can pass through air easily, that is why the sun looks red. Even the green laser has higher scattering effect than the red laser, we probably will find green laser brighter due to the reason that our eyes are most sensitive to green in low energy level.

When there are particles in air, the scattering is no longer following the Rayleigh scattering rule, people are using the Mie scattering to approximate such case, where the forward peaking is much higher than the other angles and such scattering is not depending on the wave length, which means we will see white sun (instead of a red one) in the foggy weather.

Suppose we have the measured data from laser sensors with angular-resolved information. Then it is an inverse transport problem to find the cloud and distinguish from the air, because the two regions are using different models. More explicitly, after a laser light into the cloud, the exit information needs to be orthogonal to the ground in order to let the reflected information to be received by the sensor.
