#### I am writing posts for two reasons

- Sometimes, a mistake could be committed multiple times without knowing it.

- Sometimes, learned special technique could be forgotten quickly if it has been concluded or understood correctly.

Write it down, it is a efficient way to memorize things. Everything that has been typed will remind me that I have done this before.

#### Using markdown and Jekyll

Use $\LaTeX$ is fine, but it costs too much time. Markdown is best suitable for writing a post with ``Jekyll``or similar generators.
