Let's consider a series of common kernel function $G(x, y)$ 's separability. The most seen functions' high separability either come from rapid decay or rapid oscillation.

The tool to quantify the separability is to use the asymptotic integral expansion, to be explicitly, it is about stationary phase theory. In practice, if there is no stationary phase, then the separability is high. No matter what case it is. If there is stationary phase or something similar, we will possibly see lower separability.
