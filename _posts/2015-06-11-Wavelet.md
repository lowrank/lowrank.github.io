Wavelet has been quite useful in signal processing, while ``fft`` is not that popular.

- ``fft`` is great since it is _exact_, convert time domain signal into frequency component. However, the information about time is completely lost, which means all information is global, only if putting them together can figure out local information.
- ``fft`` is not useful when frequency is changing, it will produce a changing feature, turning a sharp component into a lot of components, losing those features.
- And it is faster than Fourier Transform. Wavelet transform has a roughly ``O(N)`` complexity which is a lot of faster than ``O(N log N)`` from ``fft``.

The difference between them has been discussed by **Strang** more than 20 years ago, and it is easy to see that ``fft`` captures frequency and loses time-elaped information(space information), and wavelet captures a rough frequency information and a rough space information, if you want one thing to be accurate, the other thing will be gone, a.k.a Uncertainty Principle.

``Matlab`` has a good wavelet toolbox, basic functions are based on a ``mex`` convolution code, algorithms are easy to reproduce on any languages which are comfortable with pointers/arrays.

I recently wrote a duplicated version of wavelet transform(``wden``) in ``C#``, and is now on github.
