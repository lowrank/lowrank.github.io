title:  Nonlinear transport
---
In many applications, the transport is modeled by linear equation. There are nonlinear ones like Burgers, numerically as a well-known example for schemes. In the differential-integral equations, there are many kinetic models like BGK. The nonlinearity plays a big role when the solution is not close to zero, higher ordered terms may dominate.

For nonlinear elliptic problems, there are many theorems about existence of solutions, critical cases telling what kind of exponent (for example the critical $(d+2)/(d-2)$). It is still unknown that what is the case for nonlinear transport, even if we know there is an approximation theory linking these two.
