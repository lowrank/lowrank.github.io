title:  Inverse Transport
---

The inverse transport has an open problem for the transition from transport regime to diffusion regime when considering the inverse problem,  for now, the uniqueness is not known yet, so we can only say something about its instability. However, we should expect there should be some function covering all cases.   

For the instability, the result will be quite difficult if there is no control on the parameter space. I suspect if there is an systematic way to handle it.

Disclaimer: The inverse transport (ITP) includes many aspects, like source, domain, medium, it could be linear or nonlinear. The most important thing lies in the X-ray transform, since it is the nature of the transport, the ballistic part of the Schwartz decomposition, the most singular part. Whenever this singular part could be seen/observed in some way, the problem will share the same stability (uniqueness) as the X-ray problem. Even though such singularity could be small (in some metric), it cannot be neglected.

For some problem with integrated measurement, it is not simple due to the loss of singularity, we shall say the data is smoothing. There are many famous problems in this topic, inverting a compact operator is not easy, one has to lose something. For Sobolev spaces, we lose derivatives, sometimes, one or two, this is common for lienarized case. sometimes we lose infinite many, the CGO technique reveals this fact very well.

Yet, there is not a complete theory rules all cases, but it seems exist. The instability result has been proved as well and it can be extended to other cases with integrated measurement.
