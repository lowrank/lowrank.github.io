title:  Inverse Transport
---

The inverse transport has an open problem for the transition from transport regime to diffusion regime when considering the inverse problem,  for now, the uniqueness is not known yet, so we can only say something about its instability. However, we should expect there should be some function covering all cases.   

For the instability, the result will be quite difficult if there is no control on the parameter space. I suspect if there is an systematic way to handle it.
